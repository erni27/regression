# regression

`regression` is a simple, written from scratch Go library for basic variants of two the most popular models from the Generalized Linear Models (GLM) family.

`regression/linear` provides implementation of the linear regression model.

`regression/logistic` provides implementation of the logistic regression model.

## Install

```
go get github.com/erni27/regression
```


## Why?

Do you need another not fancy machine learning library? Actually, you don't. The main puropose of `regression` library is learning. Machine learning and AI algorithms remains mystified and magic. So here it is a simple, written from scratch implementation of one of the most popular algorithms solving regression and classification problem. It doesn't throw the responsibility for underyling math (like matrix calculus and iterative optimisation) to the external packages. Everything is embedded in this repository.
